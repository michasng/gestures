A video dictionary for one dialect of German sign language. ðŸ‘‹

This progessive web app allows users to browse a large library of signs by category or find specific ones by their corresponding German words. A list of favorites enables quick access to important words.

This project was realized in cooperation with [Ursberger GebÃ¤rden](https://www.ursberger-gebaerden.de/).

It is now live on https://ursberger-gebaerden.web.app.
A production account is required for video access.
